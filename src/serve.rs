//! The gateway: an Anthropic Messages endpoint on loopback that sends every
//! request out as the account in use.
//!
//! A client that speaks the Anthropic API — pi, through its `models.json` —
//! points its base URL here and presents the gateway key. pi takes any key
//! spelled `sk-ant-oat…` for an OAuth token and does the Claude Code shaping
//! itself: the bearer header, the OAuth betas, the identity line at the head
//! of the system prompt. Routing reads the model field without altering the body.
//! The client's key is
//! swapped for the account's access token and the rest is relayed as it came,
//! both ways, with the response streamed as it arrives.
//!
//! This module is the wire: parsing what a client sends, deciding what to
//! forward, and writing what comes back. Which account answers is `cmd`'s
//! business, asked over a channel from the thread that holds the connection.
